# Data Analytics Projects

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8%2B-blue)

This repository contains data analytics projects developed while I was studying an IBM course. Each project demonstrates different aspects of data analytics, from data wrangling to model development and evaluation.
